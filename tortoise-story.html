        <p>Once upon a time, a tortoise and a hare had an argument about who was faster.</p>
        <p>They decided to settle the argument with a race. They agreed on a route and started off the race.</p>
        <p>The hare shot ahead and ran briskly for some time. Then, seeing he was far ahead of the tortoise, he thought he’d sit down and rest for a while before continuing the race. He sat down under a tree and soon fell fast asleep.</p>
        <p>The tortoise, plodding along, soon overtook him, passed him, crossed the finish line, and won the race.</p>
        <p>The hare woke up and realized he’d lost.</p>
        <p>Many people will conclude that Slow and Steady win the race. When I read the story, I feel that the real lesson is not about the tortoise at all, it’s about the hare.</p>
        <p>The hare made a huge mistake, believing in its ability but then not actually proving it. In real life, you may have that great skill, one which everyone agrees, but you must still showcase that skill to win the competition.</p>
        <p><strong>Moral:</strong> Success depends on using your talents, not just having them.</p>
